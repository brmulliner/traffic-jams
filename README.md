Simple Traffic Flow Simulations

The smooth flow of traffic in a road network is paramount for the users and others in order to reduce journey
time, lower emissions and improve safety. The flow of traffic can be simulated through kinetic theory by taking
into consideration the movement of individual cars. These simulations can be used to predict the effects on
real world traffic flow by adjusting features of the road itself such as speed limit and number of lanes; and
extrinsic properties such as traffic density and driver behaviour.

The data obtained through these simulations can be of great use to those involved with the planning or management
of future or current road networks. It can be shown what conditions are required of the network in order for
maximum flow rate to be achieved. In this paper a sample road will be simulated and it will be determined what
conditions maximise th flow rate of =the cars on this road.
